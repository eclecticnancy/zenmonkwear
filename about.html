			<h3>About</h3>
			<img src="images/shuji-headshot.jpg" alt="Shuji headshot"/>
			<p>I have been a professional tailor since the mid 1970’s, owning a tailor shop in Lincoln Nebraska for 12 years.  In 2011, I was priest ordained in the Soto Zen Buddhist tradition in Katagiri’s linage.  I have had the privilege of studying with many different zen sewers, and I am trying to keep the traditional garments alive, the Nyoho-e way of sewing.  I now view my sewing practice as my way of sharing the Dharma, and as a form of working meditation.  All items are custom made to your measurements, traditions, and fabric choices.</p>
			<p>I am currently head teacher at Just Sit, Soto Zen in Grand Rapids, in Grand Rapids Michigan.  I enjoy spending as much time as I can at Ryumonji Monastery in Northeastern Iowa and Shasta Abbey in Northern California.</p>
